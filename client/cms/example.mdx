“Across the Pacific, listening is essential to life.”[1] This is how Mere Nailatikau opens the first episode of _Listening Across Fault Lines_. On a quiet, frosty January morning on the other side of the Pacific from the knowledge holders interviewed for each episode of _Listening Across Fault Lines_, I donned my best headphones and gazed out the window at the tops of the willow tree outside. The usual drone of car tires regularly driving past my house was absent in this early Sunday hour, all the more perfect to experience the third episode of the podcast, entitled “Stories of Oceanic Life.” With all the water on our property frozen in a cold snap – pipes, drains, showers, and all – it feels like the right time to be reminded of what listening to waters and their many relations have to teach us and communicate to us, through their always shifting movements and agency on this planet.

Listening and ‘dialogue’ are two principles evoked by settler colonizers in Canada who swear that they are enacting ‘good relations’ with Indigenous peoples and with stolen lands and waters across the country. As I watch, as a Red River Métis scholar, to an ever-accelerating ecocide unfold across the country, I am not convinced that the majority of euro-colonial settlers who claim to be ‘listening’ and ‘dialoguing’ with Indigenous peoples actually understand what listening (or Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination) truly entails. And I do not believe settlers here understand what listening to fish and water as relatives actually means. As AM Kanngieser has shown in their recent scholarship, this is because euro-western concepts of listening are still so deeply shaped by what they call _sonic colonialities – possessive forms of listening that still serve euro-colonial extraction and ego_.[2]

This is one of the reasons why _Stories of Oceanic Life_ is so powerful. Each knowledge holder, custodian, artist, philosopher, and scholar interviewed unfolds such deeply layered, embodied, and instructive perspectives on what listening means within their own communities and practices – and why listening to fish, to place, to relations is so important in the face of ongoing environmental harm. Early in the episode, as the sound of reef fish grunts and purrs and the lapping of water are layered under Simione Sevudredre’s voice, he explains the many dimensions and responsibilities carried by listening. He explains: “the Indigenous understanding of listening goes beyond the auditory listening. To listen in our Indigenous way, one not only listens with the ears, one listens with the mind, and also listens with the heart, and also listens with the spirit. These various levels have their significance and their purposes […] if one is only to listen with the auditory or just the ears, a lot can be missed out on the emotional dimension, the spiritual dimension, etc.”[3]

Across the full documentary, interviews with Unaisi Nabobo-Baba, Lydia Jacob, Simione Sevudredre, Teweiariki Teaero, and Philip Tacom underscore how deeply interdependent people, and environment are within their respective communities, and how important it is for humans to honour place, ancestors, and relationships through listening. Each knowledge holder carefully demonstrates to the audience that listening, _the kind of listening fostered by attuning to silence, sounds, relationships, and ancestors across the Pacific_, is so much more than what the English concept of listening suggests. And this is exactly why Stories of Oceanic Life is exactly what euro-colonial settlers here in Canada –and many other places – must listen to in order for us to have any hope of the colonial state of Canada finally understanding and honouring Indigenous self-determination and governance in the face of colonial ecocide. Because, as Mere explains so early on: “listening is essential to life.”[4] And our lives are so deeply interwoven.

I remove my headphones with gratitude. And I try to listen for the silences outside my window on this side of the Pacific with a bit more care than I had just 21:43 minutes before.
